# Group Website - Nakama Group
The project consists of creating a website that serves as an introduction to our team of 5 people, which we've named Nakama.
In terms of technologies, it has allowed us to consolidate what we have been learning in recent weeks about layout: HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Media Queries, Github, Sass, Grid, etc. We have also used the Adalab Web Starter Kit as a tool to organize our project.
Additionally, it has been an opportunity to start working as a team, getting to know each other, and applying the Agile philosophy, as constant communication has been key to moving the project forward.

## Structure
The website consists of two pages: a homepage and a contact page. The browser initially displays the homepage, and to visit the contact page, you need to click on the top right of the website where the link is located. For more details:

## Homepage
A header with the team name and a navigation menu that directs to different parts of the main page or to the contact page.
A hero section containing a gif and our team's motto.
A section called "team" where we summarize our strengths and objectives as a group.
A section called "who we are" featuring each group member with their avatar, name, a brief personal description, and various icons that, when clicked, direct you to the indicated social network.
A footer with our group name, the logo of our training school, and the same hyperlinks as in the header.
Contact Page
The same header as on the homepage.
A hero section that changes from a gif to an image.
A contact form where users can enter their full name, email, phone number, and a message. All fields except the "phone" must be filled out. Finally, there's a "send" button to submit the entered data.
The same footer as on the homepage.
